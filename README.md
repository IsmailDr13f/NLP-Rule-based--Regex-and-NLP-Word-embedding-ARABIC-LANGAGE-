# NLP Rule based, Regex and NLP Word embedding-ARABIC LANGAGE-
In this lab, the primary objective is to gain familiarity with various techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically focusing on rule-based methods, regular expressions (Regex), and word embeddings. Rule-based approaches involve creating a set of predefined rules to process and analyze text data, enabling tasks such as text classification or information extraction. Regular expressions (Regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation, useful for tasks like text preprocessing or extracting specific information from unstructured text data. NLP word embeddings refer to techniques that represent words as dense vectors in a continuous vector space, capturing semantic relationships between words. Understanding and utilizing word embeddings is crucial for tasks such as sentiment analysis, document classification, and machine translation. Overall, this lab aims to provide hands-on experience with these fundamental NLP techniques, enabling participants to apply them effectively in various text processing tasks.
